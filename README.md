# Data Structure and Procedural Programming checkpoint

In the first exercise of this checkpoint i have created an Algorithm that  Given two sets of elements, finds the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.

In the second exercise i have created a procedure which calculates in the variable ps, the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2 (v1 and v2 are vectors of IR), and then an algorithm that determines, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of given IR are orthogonal, by calling the procedure defined in the previous question.
